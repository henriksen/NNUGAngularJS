NNUGAngularJS
=============

Example for my NNUG talk on AngularJS. Follow along in the commits to see the different stages the code was in during the presentation. 

This is not production quality code!
------------------------------------
Especially the backend part. Do **not** view the C# backend code as any form of best practice or guidance on how to communicate with a JavaScript application. It was simply a quick and dirty way of tossing some backend data into the solution. 

That said, if you have any questions on the code, go ahead and contact me.
